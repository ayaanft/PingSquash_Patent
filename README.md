# PingSquash_Patent

I created this patent application in 2021 over COVID-19 quarantine. I was quite bored over that summer as I couldn't really go out to meet my friends, so I ended up taking some planks and screws we had in the backyard and assembling this game. I had heard a lot of people brag about how many patents they had to their name, so I wanted to see how hard it was to truly file a patent application and get one approved.
